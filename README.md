# Polyphony
A more robust implementation of PluralKit that hooks into the PluralKit API

[Join our support and development server](https://discord.gg/WuuVJ72M4r)

# How to Run
## Step 1: Create a bot
- Create a new bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Turn off "Public Bot"
- Turn on "Presence Intent" and "Server Members Intent"

## Step 2: Create a `.env` file or set enviroment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root to set your environment variables. Polyphony takes all of it's configuration in the form of environment variables.

**Required**
- `TOKEN` - Discord Bot Token
- `GUILD_ID` - Guild ID of server Polyphony is being used in

**Role System**
- `MODERATOR_ROLES` - List of role names (default: [Moderator, Moderators])
- `INSTANCE_ADD_ROLE` - Comma-separated list (no spaces) of role names to automatically add to instance when started (default: [])
- `INSTANCE_REMOVE_ROLE` - Comma-separated list (no spaces) of role names to automatically remove from instance when started (default: [])
- `ALWAYS_SYNC_ROLES` - Comma-separated list (no spaces) of role names assigned to the main user that should always be synced to the member instance (default: [])
- `NEVER_SYNC_ROLES` - Comma-separated list (no spaces) of role names assigned to member instances that should never be synced to the main user
- `DISABLE_ROLESYNC_ROLES` - Comma-separated list (no spaces) of role names that disable rolesync (default: [])
- `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_PERMS` - The permissions to suggest from the invite link generated by the invite command. (default: none, does not create a role)
- `LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID` - **Not Implemented Yet** Channel to log Polyphony events (message edits, deletes, user updates, and errors) to
- `COMMAND_PREFIX` - The prefix to be used in Discord to activate Polyphony commands (default: ;;)
- `ADMIN_LOGS_CHANNEL_ID` - (Future Feature) Where to put warnings and other logging messages. Make sure it is somewhere you can see. (default: none)

**Delete Logs:** If your server uses a delete logging bot, Polyphony will clean the extra delete log messages created by proxying.
- `DELETE_LOGS_CHANNEL_ID` - The channel ID where your server puts delete logs, the message ID needs to appear somewhere in the embed (default: 0)
- `DELETE_LOGS_USER_ID` - The user ID that posts the delete logs (default: 0)

**Advanced/Development**
- `DEBUG` - Python Boolean, Activates Debug Mode
- `DATABASE_URI` - Location of the SQLite database ([See more info here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)) (default: (project root)/polyphony/polyphony.db)
- `SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` - How many users to concurrently sync. Higher numbers can sometimes be slower. Some systems can handle more than others. (default: 5)

## Step 3: Install Dependancies
This project requires Python 3.9.1 and SQLite >=3.25.0 

Dependency, testing, and build management is done using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Install Poetry on your system and then run `poetry install` in the project root.

## Step 4: Run
To run polyphony, use `poetry run polyphony`.

## Step 5: Use
How to add a member:
1. Create a new bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
